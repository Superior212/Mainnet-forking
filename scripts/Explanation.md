# Token Swap Script Explanation

```javascript
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
const helpers = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");
```
- These lines import necessary libraries. `ethers` is used for interacting with Ethereum, and `helpers` provides utilities for working with Hardhat (a development environment for Ethereum).

```javascript
const main = async () => {
  // ... (function body)
};
```
- This defines an asynchronous function named `main`. Asynchronous functions allow for operations that take time (like blockchain interactions) without blocking the rest of the code.

```javascript
const USDCAddress = "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48";
const DAIAddress = "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F";
```
- These lines define the Ethereum addresses for USDC and DAI tokens on the mainnet.

```javascript
const UNIRouter = "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D";
```
- This is the address of the Uniswap V2 Router contract, which facilitates token swaps.

```javascript
const USDCHolder = "0xf584f8728b874a6a5c7a8d4d387c9aae9172d621";
```
- This is the address of a known USDC holder on the mainnet. We'll impersonate this account for testing.

```javascript
await helpers.impersonateAccount(USDCHolder);
const impersonatedSigner = await ethers.getSigner(USDCHolder);
```
- These lines use Hardhat to impersonate the USDC holder's account, allowing us to act as if we were that account.

```javascript
const amountOut = ethers.parseUnits("2000", 6);
const amountIn = ethers.parseUnits("1980", 18);
```
- These define the amounts for the swap. We want to receive 2000 USDC and are willing to spend up to 1980 DAI.
- `parseUnits` converts human-readable numbers to the appropriate token units (USDC has 6 decimal places, DAI has 18).

```javascript
const USDC = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", USDCAddress, impersonatedSigner);
const DAI = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", DAIAddress);
```
- These lines create JavaScript objects representing the USDC and DAI token contracts.

```javascript
const ROUTER = await ethers.getContractAt("IUniswapV2Router02", UNIRouter, impersonatedSigner);
```
- This creates a JavaScript object representing the Uniswap Router contract.

```javascript
await USDC.approve(UNIRouter, amountOut);
```
- This approves the Uniswap Router to spend our USDC tokens.

```javascript
const usdcBal = await USDC.balanceOf(impersonatedSigner.address);
const daiBal = await DAI.balanceOf(impersonatedSigner.address);
```
- These lines fetch the current USDC and DAI balances of our impersonated account.

```javascript
const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 10;
```
- This sets a deadline for the swap (current time plus 10 minutes).

```javascript
console.log("USDC balance before swap", Number(usdcBal));
console.log("DAI balance before swap", Number(daiBal));
```
- These lines log the balances before the swap.

```javascript
await ROUTER.swapTokensForExactTokens(
  amountOut,
  amountIn,
  [USDCAddress, DAIAddress],
  impersonatedSigner.address,
  deadline
);
```
- This performs the actual token swap using Uniswap.
- It specifies the exact amount of USDC we want to receive, the maximum DAI we're willing to spend, the swap path, where to send the tokens, and the deadline.

```javascript
const usdcBalAfter = await USDC.balanceOf(impersonatedSigner.address);
const daiBalAfter = await DAI.balanceOf(impersonatedSigner.address);
```
- These fetch the new balances after the swap.

```javascript
console.log("USDC balance after swap", Number(usdcBalAfter));
console.log("DAI balance after swap", Number(daiBalAfter));
```
- These log the new balances after the swap.

```javascript
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```
- This runs the `main` function and sets up error handling. If an error occurs, it will be logged and the script will exit with an error code.
